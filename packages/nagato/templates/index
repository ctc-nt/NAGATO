# Regular expressions are supported in all fields except the first.
# Last field supports variable length command completion.
# abc[[xyz]] is expanded to abc(x(y(z)?)?)?, regexp inside [[]] is not supported
#
# Rules of Ordering:
#  - OS in alphabetical order
#  - Template name in length order (longest to shortest)
#  - When Length is the same, use alphabetical order
#  - Keep space between OS's
# 
# Header is not necessary because it is appended to the index of remote
# Remote header is "Template, Hostname, Platform, Command"
