# This file is appended to ntc template's index after NetmikoLibrary's import.
# 
# Regular expressions are supported in all fields except the first.
# Last field supports variable length command completion.
# abc[[xyz]] is expanded to abc(x(y(z)?)?)?, regexp inside [[]] is not supported
#
# Rules of Ordering:
#  - OS in alphabetical order
#  - Template name in length order (longest to shortest)
#  - When Length is the same, use alphabetical order
#  - Keep space between OS's
# 
# Header "Template, Hostname, Platform, Command" is not necessary 
# because it is appended to ntc template's index
